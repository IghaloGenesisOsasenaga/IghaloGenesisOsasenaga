## Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
If you said *SpongeBob SquarePants*, you're not allowed to read this 🧐. Just kidding 😂.

I am a **boy** and a frontend developer with the following skills:
- Responsive Web App development (React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, BootstrapCSS)
- Competitive programming (Python, JavaScript, C++, Kotlin)
- Team Collaboration.
- Making people smile/laugh 🙂😎.

I have interests in, **Cryptography**, **Mathematics** (specifically *Number Theory* and *Linear Algebra* don't get me wrong here 😂), **Learning new things**.

Currently I'm not working on anything new. And I'm always open to collaborate on exciting projects.

### Fun Fact:
   I didn't expect to get this far in this description 🥲
